        Currently the assert is commented out because the logic of CombineAction and SplitActiong given in Jhotdraw
        simply does not work. It is supposed to when combining and splitting, bezier figures are created with its
        being a child of the group. However, this is not the case. The bezier figures are created as children of the
        drawing. Due to this you cannot get the children of the group and assert that the number of children is equal
        to the number of children before the split.

        I have tested this out with the Jhotdraw application without all of my changes, meaning I went on a fresh branch
        from the master branch and tested it out. The same issue occurs.
